//         'A comprehensive overview of GBV, its causes, patterns, and impact on communities.',
//     body: '''
// Gender-Based Violence (GBV) remains one of the most urgent human rights issues in South Africa. 
// It affects individuals of all ages, but disproportionately impacts women, children, and vulnerable groups.

// ## What Is GBV?
// GBV refers to any harm inflicted upon a person because of their gender identity or perceived gender roles. 
// This includes physical violence, emotional abuse, sexual assault, stalking, economic violence, and more.

// ## Root Causes
// The roots of GBV stem from social norms, inequality, patriarchy, and the normalization of violent behavior.
// Many cases go unreported due to fear, shame, or dependency on abusers.

// ## Impact on Society
// GBV does not only affect survivors; it threatens safety, limits economic opportunities, and breaks down family structures.
// South Africa faces one of the world’s highest femicide rates — an ongoing crisis that requires collective action.

// ## Moving Forward
// Education, community support, and accessible resources are vital in preventing future incidents.
// GBVInsights aims to support awareness, reporting, and safe access to help.

//     summary:
//         'Learn how to identify emotional and psychological manipulation in relationships.',
//     body: '''
// Emotional abuse is one of the most overlooked forms of GBV because it leaves no physical scars.
// It involves behaviors meant to control, manipulate, or weaken another person emotionally.

// ## Warning Signs
// 1. Constant criticism or humiliation  
// 2. Controlling where you go or who you see  
// 3. Gaslighting — making you doubt your reality  
// 4. Isolation from friends or family  
// 5. Blaming you for their own mistakes  
// 6. Threatening to leave or harm themselves  
// 7. Withholding affection or silent treatment  
// 8. Monitoring your phone or messages  
// 9. Jealousy disguised as “care”  
// 10. Making you feel guilty for wanting personal time

// ## Why It’s Dangerous
// Emotional abuse often escalates into physical or sexual violence.
// Recognizing early signs helps survivors seek support before situations worsen.

// ## What Survivors Can Do
// Reach out to trusted friends, support groups, or a helpline. No one deserves to feel unsafe or controlled.

//         'Community-driven programs that protect survivors and promote safe environments.',
//     body: '''
// Communities play a critical role in preventing GBV and supporting survivors. 
// When people unite, share information, and intervene safely, violence is less likely to occur.

// ## Community Strategies
// • Establishing safe community watch programs  
// • Hosting awareness workshops and school talks  
// • Training residents on identifying abuse  
// • Supporting shelters and volunteer networks  
// • Promoting positive masculinity programs

// ## Building Safe Spaces
// Creating safe spaces allows survivors to speak freely without judgement.
// Communities must encourage open conversations, educate youth, and challenge harmful stereotypes.

// ## The Power of Collective Action
// GBV is not a private issue — it affects entire neighborhoods and future generations.
// Communities that work together see improved safety and reduced violence.

//         'Practical steps to help someone experiencing abuse in a safe and supportive way.',
//     body: '''
// Supporting a survivor is about listening, believing, and helping them regain control.

// ## How to Support Them
// • Believe their story and avoid judgement  
// • Listen more than you speak  
// • Encourage them to seek professional help  
// • Offer to help with transport or reporting  
// • Respect their decisions, even if they choose not to report  

// ## What Not to Do
// Never blame them, force them to leave, or confront the abuser on their behalf.
// This can escalate the danger.

// ## Your Role
// Being a supportive friend or family member can save a life.
// Small actions create safe pathways for survivors to heal.

//     body: '''
// Education is one of the strongest tools for preventing GBV.
// Through structured learning, young people can understand respect, consent, boundaries, and equality.

// ## Why Start in Schools?
// Children absorb social norms early. Teaching healthy relationships reduces harmful behaviors later.

// ## Tools for Prevention
// • GBV workshops  
// • Role-play scenarios  
// • Safe reporting channels  
// • Anti-bullying initiatives  
// • Campus-based support centers

// ## Long-Term Impact
// Education promotes gender equality and encourages healthy, respectful behavior in future adults.
